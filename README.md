In this repository, you'll learn about me, my projects and my work ethics.

## About me:
Hi my name is fabiÃ«nne Leidekker. I'm currently studying ICT & Software at Fontys university in Eindhoven. Besides software I've been specialising in the field of mobile development and design.
I consider myself a full-stack developer, where the software is as important as the design and experience.

I'm born and raised in the Netherlands, so Dutch is my first language, but I also speak English fluently and have basic knowledge of German. I'm very dedicated to the things a make. I work hard to keep improving my skills. I can also work well in a group, but working individually is also not a problem.

As an ICT & Software student, I've had the opportunity to work with multiple programming languages, such as C#, Java, Javascript, Swift and Kotlin (and HTML and CSS, but they are considered mark-up and styling languages). But I'm very adaptable to learning a new language!
